we have a scale
we represent Chords as root, presence of which pitches and how many octaves doubling,
  then the representation of which ones are played in rhythm section

we write algorithms to find a bassline and melody and put those in separate instruments

# way to create a part that plays to MIDI
midi_part = s.new_midi_part("my midi part", "IAC", start_channel=7, num_channels=1)

A class for constructing a composition. Melody algorithsm, chord list or chord generators. Bass algorithms.
MIDI instrument: channel, device. or sound font instrument
