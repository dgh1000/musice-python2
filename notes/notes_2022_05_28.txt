Goal: 
- specify melody rhythm in flexible way
    - use "holes"
- eventually specify bassline and harmony in flexible way too
- need to rewrite melody generation to look at holes in order and look up
    associated harmony with any given hole
- need to look at prior determined pitch

- looking up harmony at a given msrbeat
- assume one harmony per measure - can still assume this
- assume one bassline per measure

Plan:

- write comp7 part that determines melody "holes" at certain positions in time
  using some kind of pattern 

- write code that looks up the harmony associated with a given MsrBeat - decide where this code should go (what class/file)

- write loop for generating melody
